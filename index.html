        My name is Shayan Hosseini, natively written as شایان حسینی.<br>

        I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in
        Computer Engineering at the <a href="http://ece.ut.ac.ir/">ECE Department</a> of
        <a href="http://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a>.<br>

		I have an extensive background in algorithms, combinatorics, and graph theory.
        When I was in high school, I won a silver medal in the
        <a href="http://inoi.ir/">Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics</a>.
        I achieved 2nd place in <a href="https://icpc.ir/">Tehran ACM ICPC Regional Contest</a>
        twice in <a href="http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc16/scoreboard/">2016</a>,
        <a href="http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc17/scoreboard/">2017</a>.

        From 2015 to 2019 I was working at <a href="http://cafebazaar.ir/">Cafebazaar</a>,
        the most popular Android application store in Iran with more than 35 million users.
